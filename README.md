# weatherForecastApp<br>
<h3>An angularJS app for getting a weather forecast for different cities.</h3>
In order to run this project you will need:<br>
1) to install nodejs first, if you don't have it yet. Go to https://nodejs.org.<br>
2) Then you need to run an <code>npm install</code> command from the project's folder to get the necessary nodejs packages.<br>
3) You will also need a local http server. I recommend nodejs 'http-server'. It's easy to install and use. In order to install it, you will want to run the following command from your terminal / cmd:<br>
<code>npm install -g http-server</code><br>
For more information on nodejs http-server you can go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server. Or feel free to use any other http server you like (xampp, lampp, open server etc).
